    <h2 class="city">Bled, Slovenia</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Bled is the hometown of my grandfather on my mother's side. At its core is a gorgeous lake that is a popular tourist attraction. I would love to visit this city to better understand my family's history and to see the sights! Here is an image of Bled Lake:</p>

    <h2 class="city">Paris, France</h2>
    <p>I've always wanted to visit Paris, as well, mainly since it is such a famous city. On top of that, however, I enjoy learning French and eating French cuisine, and I would like to immerse myself in this culture and language someday. See below for a picture of the Eiffel Tower:</p>
