    <h2 class="city">Bled, Slovenia</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Bled is the hometown of my grandfather on my mother's side. At its core is a gorgeous lake that is a popular tourist attraction. I would love to visit this city to better understand my family's history and to see the sights! Here is an image of Bled Lake:</p>

    <h2 class="city">Paris, France</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">I've always wanted to visit Paris, as well, mainly since it is such a famous city. On top of that, however, I enjoy learning French and eating French cuisine, and I would like to immerse myself in this culture and language someday. See below for a picture of the Eiffel Tower:</p>

    <h2 class="city">Reykjavik, Iceland</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">I love to spend time in nature and especially appreciate beautiful landscapes. Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is surrounded by incredible mountains, seas and clear skies. To me, it sounds like an idyllic vacation spot. Here is an image of some of the amazing landscape in Reykjavik:</p>

    <h2 class="city">Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">My father's family comes mainly from the Netherlands, so, naturally, I have always been interested in travelling to its capital city, Amsterdam. My Dutch heritage has given me great meals and family time, and I would love to explore my root culture more in depth one day. Amsterdam is known for its canals and cyclists. Here is a picture of the city I would love to see at some point in my life:</p>

    <h2 class="city">London, England</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">London is one of those cities that many people think of as a travel destination. I would love to visit this city, since a small portion of my father's family comes from England. Additionally, I am a huge <i>Harry Potter</i> fan, and it would be super cool to be able to better visualize the city that is the home of this fictional world.</p>
